// We'll show an example of the built in iterator methods like forEach, map, find, filter and reduce which can be used instead of a for loop.  

var snacks = ['cookies', 'crackers', 'chips', 'popcorn', 'pretzels']

// 1. Using the snacks array, this function will use a for loop to iterate over each snack and print an interpolated string to the console for each snack.
//Uncomment the invocation below to see it print to the console.

    var statement = `I love ${snack}.`
    console.log(statement)
  })

    return snack.length === 5
  })
  console.log(foundSnack)

// 6. Reduce is pretty spicy!  Uncomment the invocation below to see the iterator method reduce() being used to iterate over the numbers array and return the sum of all the numbers.

var numbers = [31, 39, 42, 28, 23, 27, 40]

// 7. You try it!  Try writing you own function called "shoutSnacks" that takes in the original "snacks" array and uses the iterator method "forEach" to console.log() each of the snacks changed to uppercase.  You'll also need to use the .toUpperCase() method.  Use MDN and google to help you!  Try it! Get weird!
